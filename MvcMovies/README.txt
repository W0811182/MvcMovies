I am restarting my MvcMovie today as I got to a roadblock on the azure deployment!
I didn't follow the instructions while doing it the first time so this time I am gonna do it cleanly :)

Part 1 - Get Started

I created my "MvcMovies" ASP.NET Core MVC .net 8 web app and ran the first test. Weirdly it did not prompt about a certificate.

Part 2 - Add a Controller

Before I start this step I am going to quickly make my github repo for this project so I can commit and push part by part

Cool! Now I have part 1 uploaded to a github repository and I can start on the next step

Part 2 is fully a testing and learning step so I am going to skip it. I am only going to commit when I complete a step and have created some code/content.

Part 3 - Add a view

I think the only thing I have to do for this step is change the "MvcMovies" in the shared layout to instead say "Movie App"
